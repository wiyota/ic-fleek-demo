# Fully On-Chain SSR dApp Demo with IC and Fleek

[Running exapmle](https://sparse-portugal-massive.functions.on-fleek.app/)

---

The demo code for a fully on-chain server-side rendered dApp using the Internet Computer and Fleek. The project is built using Next.js and the Fleek Next Adapter. Utilize this template to harness Fleekâ€™s optimized hosting and IC's extensive capabilities for dynamic and performance-driven web applications.

## Prerequisites

- [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install)
- Node 18.18.0+
- [Fleek](https://fleek.xyz/) Account
- [Fleek CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/cli)
- [Fleek Next Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/next)

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/><your-id>/ic-fleek-demo.git
```

3. Start IC SDK _on another terminal window_:

```bash
// on another terminal window
dfx start --clean --background
```

4. Enter the correct directory, install dependencies, and run locally:

```bash
cd ic-fleek-demo
npm i --prefix frontend
npm run dev
```

5. Ensure that you install the Fleek CLI and the Fleek Next Adapter:

```bash
// local installation
npm i @fleek-platform/cli --prefix frontend
npm i @fleek-platform/next --prefix frontend

// global installation
npm i -g @fleek-platform/cli
npm i -g @fleek-platform/next

```

ðŸ’¡: you can check the Fleek CLI version by running fleek -v. Any version >= 2.10.1 should be good. As for the Fleek Next adapter, you can check the Fleek Next Adapter version by running fleek-next -v. Any version >= 2.1.0 should be good.

## Building and Deploying

1. First, Deploy the backend canister to the IC mainnet:

```bash
dfx deploy --ic
```

2. Build the frontend project using the Fleek Next Adapter:

```bash
(cd frontend && npx fleek-next build)
# or if installed globally
(cd frontend && fleek-next build)
```

3. Now, Create the Fleek Function using the Fleek CLI:

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions create --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions create --name ic-next-function

```

4. Finally, deploy using the Fleek CLI:

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path frontend/.fleek/dist/index.js --assets frontend/.fleek/static --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path frontend/.fleek/dist/index.js --assets frontend/.fleek/static --name ic-next-function
```

As you complete all the steps successfully here, you will be able to access your fullstack Next.js app using a link that looks like this- https://brief-disease-harsh.functions.on-fleek.app/
